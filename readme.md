@channel today's task Based on markus code :
add function called make_transfer that transfer money between two accounts, make sure you add and remove the balance from the sender and receiver
If the id is not valid add statement that prints 'customer does not exist' in functions like update,delete, and display
create function called make_vip that  adds a keyword VIP and set it to be true if the balance of client is higher than 10000 euros
when you finish share the solution with me and markus before pushing it to your github profile
